# Testing

Testing ensures your program works as expected. Writing tests provides an easy, repeatable, fast way to make sure modules don't break on changes or dependency updates. It promotes writing code in a style that's modular and avoids side effects.

Integration testing versions functional (end-to-end) test versus unit testing. Don't test vendor code!
